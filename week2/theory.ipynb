    "# Theoretical Exercises week 2\n",
    "**Like last week, it is very imporant that you try to solve every exercise. It is not important that you answer correctly. Spend no more than 5-10 min on each exercise. If you do not solve the exercise, focus on understanding the question, and try to figure out what it is you do not understand.**\n",

    "The TA's will be very happy to answer questions during the TA session or on the board.\n",

    "You might want to spend a bit more than 10 min on 5, 6 and 8, they are substantially harder than the rest of the exercises. Question 8 is mainly for the interested student with time left over. Do not despair if you cannot solve them, but try to understand the question and pinpoint which parts you do not understand. \n",

    "\n",
    "   1. During the course, the lecturer gave Ben a photo album with images of different birds and their name. Ben needs to learn the names of all the birds. At the exam, Ben will be given several images for which he needs to name the birds.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "   2. During the course, the lecturer gave Ben several recordings of birds singing. For this task the lecturer doesn't care about names. At the exam, Ben will be given recordings he needs to seperate into two groups based on how similar they sound.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Ben notices one significant difference between the two tasks. In the first, his supervisor gave him the correct answer for each image. This is called *supervised learning* because the supervisor provides a correct answer. In the second task, his supervisor did not give him a correct answer. Instead, Ben had to group the audio samples based on similarity. This is called *unsupervised learning*, because there is not supervision in terms of correct answers. \n",
    "\n",

In the first, he has to assign each bird to a class. This is called *classification*. In the second task, he has to assign a real number to each bird. This is called *regression*.

    "Linear Regression is described on page 84 in the book, it even has a nice image (Figure 3.3). You might wonder why the above formula has the bias $b$ term and the formula in the book doesn't. This is because of the notational trick described on page 5-7. In this exercise we consider the 1-dimensional case with $b=0$\n",
